# API Documentation

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Backend delpoyed on [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) <br>

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Getting started

To get the project running :


- Clone this repo
- **cd into desired folder** to be able to work with desired function
- **npm i** to install all required dependencies
- **serverless config** to create relationship with AWS account
- **serverless deploy** to deploy a function to AWS 
- **handler.js** to run a javascipt function locally, after it is defined outside of an exported function 

### Backend framework goes here
Labby is a Function as a service / serverless application consisting of AWS Lmabda functions connected to a Postgresql database, and uses a Slackbot to interact with users. 

- Function as a service framework allowing us to develop, run, and manage application functionalities without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure typically associated with developing and launching an app.
- Lambda functions allow us to write and run code without provisioning or managing servers allowing our code to run fast and reducing costs
- Lambda functions allow us to write code in multiple languages Like Node, Go and Python. 
- Using a Slackbot allows us to create a personable conversation tool that is easy to interact with. AWS has a service Lex that assists us in building out the Slackbot
- Connecting to a Postgresql data base allows us to store and query our database in a relational manner. Allowing us to easily make joins and connections between tables.

# Data Model

üö´This is just an example. Replace this with your data model

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ ORGANIZATIONS

---

```
{
  id: UUID
  name: STRING
  industry: STRING
  paid: BOOLEAN
  customer_id: STRING
  subscription_id: STRING
}
```

#### USERS

---

```
{
  id: UUID
  organization_id: UUID foreign key in ORGANIZATIONS table
  first_name: STRING
  last_name: STRING
  role: STRING [ 'owner', 'supervisor', 'employee' ]
  email: STRING
  phone: STRING
  cal_visit: BOOLEAN
  emp_visit: BOOLEAN
  emailpref: BOOLEAN
  phonepref: BOOLEAN
}
```

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Actions

üö´ This is an example, replace this with the actions that pertain to your backend

`getOrgs()` -> Returns all organizations

`getOrg(orgId)` -> Returns a single organization by ID

`addOrg(org)` -> Returns the created org

`updateOrg(orgId)` -> Update an organization by ID

`deleteOrg(orgId)` -> Delete an organization by ID
<br>
<br>
<br>
`getUsers(orgId)` -> if no param all users

`getUser(userId)` -> Returns a single user by user ID

`addUser(user object)` --> Creates a new user and returns that user. Also creates 7 availabilities defaulted to hours of operation for their organization.

`updateUser(userId, changes object)` -> Updates a single user by ID.

`deleteUser(userId)` -> deletes everything dependent on the user

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables.

create a .env file that includes the following:

üö´ These are just examples, replace them with the specifics for your app
    
    *  STAGING_DB - optional development db for using functionality not available in SQLite
    *  NODE_ENV - set to "development" until ready for "production"
    *  JWT_SECRET - you can generate this by using a python shell and running import random''.join([random.SystemRandom().choice('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789!@#\$%^&amp;*(-*=+)') for i in range(50)])
    *  SENDGRID_API_KEY - this is generated in your Sendgrid account
    *  stripe_secret - this is generated in the Stripe dashboard
