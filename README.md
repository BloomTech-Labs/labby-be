# API Documentation

#### Backend delpoyed on [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) <br>

## Getting started

To get the project running :

- Clone this repo
- **cd into desired folder** to be able to work with desired function
- **npm i** to install all required dependencies
- **serverless config** to create relationship with AWS account
- **serverless deploy** to deploy a function to AWS 
- **handler.js** to run a javascipt function locally, after it is defined outside of an exported function 

### Backend framework 
Labby is a Function as a service / serverless application consisting of AWS Lmabda functions connected to a Postgresql database, and uses AWS Lex chatbot integrated with a Slack bot application through the Slack API to interact with users. 

- Function as a service framework allows us to develop, run, and manage application functionalities without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure typically associated with developing and launching an app.
- Lambda functions allow us to write and run code without provisioning or managing servers allowing our code to run fast and reducing costs
- Lambda functions allow us to write code in multiple languages Like Node, Go and Python. 
- Using a Slackbot allows us to create a personable conversation tool that is easy to interact with. AWS has a service Lex that assists us in building out the Slackbot
- Connecting to a Postgresql data base allows us to store and query our database in a relational manner. Allowing us to easily make joins and connections between tables. 

## Endpoints

Endpoints must be prefixed with the AWS URL which can be found in the API gateway section of the AWS console.
